As you can see, we've intentionally gone with a minimal, underdeveloped design for this project. The reason for this is twofold. First, from a learning perspective, we want you to focus on this module's main skill: using jQuery to create an interactive web page. The HTML and CSS skeleton we've provided in the starter files allows you to get up and running quickly, without having to think about designing or writing HTML and CSS for now.

Second, when you're writing software professionally, it's almost always preferable to first create an entirely unpolished but functional prototype of the app. This allows you to connect the thread between the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript layer quickly, and to start getting feedback on basic functionality. You may discover that the underlying features of the app need to drastically change or you need to add new elements, and you won't have sunk time into perfecting the styling of your content, which now needs an overhaul. Getting rapid feedback on the underlying functionality of an app is much more important than perfecting the styling at first.

To complete this challenge requires:

Using DOM manipulation and traversal to dynamically add and remove HTML elements and apply styles.
Linking to an externally hosted library (jQuery) and a locally hosted JavaScript file (index.js).
Linking to your application JavaScript file from the index.html page.
Using this and event delegation
Requirements
In terms of user experience, your shopping list app must allow users to:

enter items they need to purchase by entering text and hitting "Return" or clicking the "Add item" button
check and uncheck items on the list by clicking the "Check" button
permanently remove items from the list
Additionally:

                You must use a CDN-hosted version of jQuery
                Put your application code in a file called index.js and link to it in index.html
                Be sure to put both script elements at the bottom of the <body> element.
                Do not alter index.html or main.css other than adding the links to the external JavaScript inside index.html. Write JavaScript code that works with the existing HTML and CSS to implement the required features.
Hint: you may find it helpful to read up on and use the following jQuery methods: .submit(), preventDefault(), toggleClass(), and closest().
When you're done, push your work up to GitHub and publish it on GitHub Pages. Submit a link to your repo below. The grading team will provide you with feedback on your work.








the purpose of this code is to enter items by entering text and hitten 'Return' OR click the 'add item' BUTTON
check and uncheck items on the list by clicking the 'Check' button
and permanently remove items from the list


You must use a CDN-hosted version of jQuery. put the application code in a file called 'index.js' and link to it in 'index.html'
Be sure to put both script elements at the bottom of the <body> element.
Do not alter index.html or main.css other than adding the links to the external JavaScript inside index.html. Write JavaScript code that works with the existing HTML and CSS to implement the required features.
